# What are some benefits of using lazy evaluation? What is the other form of evaluation and where is it used?

One benefit of using lazy evaluation include saving time and memory, as lazy evaluation entails expressions not being evaluated until their values are needed. From there, another benefit of lazy evaluation is that it is actually possible to make modular code such that the definition of a function is separate from the evaluation at. 

During runtime, it is also possible to cache the computation from a function and store it for later use, reducing the need to repeatedly do the same computing which wastes both time and memory/spacial resources. Thus, performance can be improved if some expressions end up not being used during the execution of a program.

Another example of evaluation is strict evaluation, which evaluates expressions as soon as it possibly can. The arguments are evaluated before the function is called, which allows it to be predictable in terms of memory allocation and program maintenance. This is particularly the case in relatively 'new' programming languages like C, Java, and Python.
