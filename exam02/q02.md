# What is the difference between `let` and `lambda` in Scheme?

The difference between `let` and `lambda` in Scheme lies in their scope and usage.

`let` has the following signature, as per Scheme documentation:

```scheme
(let ((var expr) ...) body1 body2 ...)
; var => the name which will be assigned to a value
; expr => the value which will be assigned to a name
; bodyN => expressions which the variables can be applied to
```

It inherently binds an arbitrarily-defined name to a value in a local scope.

Meanwhile, `lambda` has the following signature, as per Scheme documentation:

```scheme
(lambda (var ...) body1 body2 ...)
; var => formal parameters of the expressions to follow
; bodyN => The body which uses aforementioned parameters as input
```

What `lambda` does is define some function along with 1 or more arguments without having to give it a name.

## Evaluate the following nested `let` expression without using a REPL:

```scheme
(let ( (y 7) )
    (let ( (x y) ) x) ) ;;
```

Breaking this down step-by-step, the first expression `let ( (y 7) )` will define the variable `y` with the numeric value 7.

From there, `y` is plugged into the next expression `(let ( (x y) ) x)` such that it is the value assigned to a variable `x`.

After this point, x is returned as shown by the following expression `(let ( (x y) ) x)`. The expected return value will be the numeric value 7.

**Final Answer: 7**
